Aim: 1. preporcessing the methylation data;

     2. calculating the differential methylation positions between case and control;
     
     3. calculating the differential methylation positions between Pre- and post-treat patients;
     
     4. calculating differential methylated regions;
     
     5. permutation test;
     
     6. normalization effect estimationg;
     
     7. Spearman rank correlation between methylation and other phenotypes.
